This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

### Simple Definition of WebSocket:
WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between a client (e.g., a browser) and a server over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike HTTP, which is request-response based, WebSocket allows data to be sent and received instantly without repeatedly opening and closing connections.

### Specific Points About Socket.IO:

1. **Socket.IO**:  
   A library built on top of WebSocket that simplifies real-time communication. It provides additional features like fallback options (e.g., long polling) if WebSocket is unavailable.

2. **`emit`**:  
   Used to send events/messages from the client or server.  
   Example:  
   ```javascript
   socket.emit('eventName', data);
   ```

3. **`on`**:  
   Listens for events/messages sent via `emit`.  
   Example:  
   ```javascript
   socket.on('eventName', (data) => {
       console.log(data);
   });
   ```

4. **Socket.IO Channels**:  
   Channels (or rooms) allow grouping sockets to broadcast messages to specific subsets of clients.  
   Example:  
   ```javascript
   socket.join('roomName'); // Join a channel
   io.to('roomName').emit('eventName', data); // Broadcast to a channel
   ```

5. **Broadcasting**:  
   Sending a message to all connected clients except the sender.  
   Example:  
   ```javascript
   socket.broadcast.emit('eventName', data); // Broadcast to all except sender
   io.emit('eventName', data); // Broadcast to all including sender
   ```

### Summary:
- **WebSocket**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication.  
- **Socket.IO**: Enhances WebSocket with features like channels, broadcasting, and fallback mechanisms.  
- **`emit`**: Sends events.  
- **`on`**: Listens for events.  
- **Channels**: Group sockets for targeted communication.  
- **Broadcasting**: Sends messages to multiple clients.
